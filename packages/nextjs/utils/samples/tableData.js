      "ChatGPT 4 Public Goods is an AI-based trading program similar to the hamster / goldfish stock traders people have made. The idea is to convince chatGPT it is playing a video game and have its choices reflected in real cryptocurrency buying-selling decisions.The goal was to create a public spectacle of trading with 1% of the funds in the wallet every day going to public goods funding taking advantage of the (potential) latent trading skill of ChatGPT to fund important infrastructure while simultaneously creating a public spectacle by posting to lens and soliciting trade advice / tips. Unfortunately my laptop internet seemed to stop working entirely so it is largely incomplete :/ This project is written entirely in Python using the Web3 library with all the RPC requests going through Alchemy and Uniswap for the trades. ChatGPT 3.5 turbo is used for the ai parts as I do not yet have access to gpt4. I had hoped to add a front end  but the wifi was not quite working so it's extremely incomplete.",

      'integrated into social media profiles or personal websites  using Metamask. It fosters community by showcasing recent messages from donors. CryptoTipJar is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables content creators to receive micro-donations (0.01 ETH) from their supporters. It is designed to be integrated into social media profiles  personal websites  or other online platforms  such as TikTok bios. By connecting a Metamask wallet  users can easily send micro-donations and leave messages to support their favorite content creators. In exchange  creators can send NFTs or other gifts to their supporters. The dApp fosters a sense of community and recognition among donors through its "recent messages" list. The CryptoTipJar project was built using various technologies  including React   Next.js  Chakra UI  ethers.js  and MetaMask.React and Next.js were used for building the frontend of the application while Chakra UI provided the design system and UI components. Ethers.js and Web3 were used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and Metamask wallet  and enabling the sending and receiving of ETH donations.',
